    <h5>WHY ENACTUS</h5>
    <p>Students in
    Enactus are given a unique oppotunity of experiencing all of the facets of social
    entrepreneurship firsthand. Project groups in Enactus are fast-paced, immersive,
    and push students to apply classrooms skills to the real world. </p>
    <h5>CLASS CREDIT</h5>
    <p>Members who have been with the organization for two semesters have the
    opportunity to participate in Enactus for class credit during subsequent semesters within the
    organization. Members who take Enactus as a class are more involved with the club and 
    complete assignments for a grade. MGMT 353 credit can be awarded for students
    who go this route.
